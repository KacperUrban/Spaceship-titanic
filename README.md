# Spaceship-titanic
Goal of this project was to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly. I conducted a EDA, feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.. I used vary models various models like xgboost,
voting classifier, SVM, logisitc regression or decision tree classifier. The best score I achieved on xgboost and was about 80%. I did this project as part of Kaggle challenge.
